            <h1>Digital Era In Making</h1>
            <p>
                As we all know the increasing use of digital electronics
                is at a huge rise and class rooms have come to our home, there is always new challanges coming in the way of
                digital learning. The most important of these is grading and evaluation. There are also changes
                in major education policies which gives us the right time to change our evaluation and grading system
                that had evaluated your marks and memory rather that the learning and knowledge. So,
                We propose a solution to this not only based on exams rather grading is done in such a
                way that its practical oriented.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                The solution to this is that,we have formulated a grading system such that exams are in objective format
                and also a 'Project/Report' work which can be done individually or as group. The project must be related
                to the subject and relevant topic and its application must be clearly explained.<br />
                These assesments are done at regular intervals and its cummuliative and these assesments add up to
                80% of your final grades.<br /><br />
                The rest 20% is formulated and split into two.<br /><br />
                1. 10% alloted to final assesment<br />
                2. 10% alloted to extra course/project.<br /><br />
                Hence learning would be knowledge oriented rather than marks oriented.
